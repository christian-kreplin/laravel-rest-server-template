# Laravel REST Server Template

This is a skeleton project for a Laravel REST Server. It's built using [DDEV](https://ddev.com/) and supposed to be used
in a dev environment.

The purpose of this project is to spin up a local environment that's working in a container and serves as a REST Server
as fast as possible. A example entity called "Products" is implemented to demonstrate the usage of the REST Server.
User Management such as registration, login and logout is implemented as well. API-Requests besides the user require the
Authentication by the usage of a Bearer Token.

## Caution (!)

This project with its default configuration is meant for **development purposes only** and should not be used in a
productive environment. It's wide open for malicious attacks. Non-Exhaustive list of what is **missing** or
**consciously disabled**:

-   Throttling / Rate Limiting
-   CORS-Protection

## Getting Started

First, install [DDEV](https://ddev.com/get-started/)

```
git clone git@github.com:christian-kreplin/laravel-rest-server-template.git
cd laravel-rest-server-template
ddev start
ddev setup
```

If you want to simply reset the database:

```
ddev reset-db
```

## Using the API

The file `insomnia.json` can be imported directly into Insomnia. All below described endpoints are part of the file.

### Authentication

The below routes are existing for user creation and authentication:

-   `/api/register` [POST] `{ "name": "foo", "email": "foo@bar.com", "password": "secret!" }`
-   `/api/login` [POST] `{ "email": "foo@bar.com", "password": "secret!" }`
-   `/api/logout` [POST]

### Testing the API

The main entity in this project is called `Products`. All basic BREAD operations are enabled for this entity:

-   `/api/products` [GET] Browse: Return list of all products
-   `/api/products/{id}` [GET] Read: Return one product
-   `/api/products/{id}` [PUT] Edit: Edit a product `{ "price": 12 }`
-   `/api/products` [POST] Add: Add a product `{ "name": "test add", "price": 20, "description: "Lorem Ipsum" }`
-   `/api/products/{id}` [DELETE] Delete: Delete a product

There are some automatic generated fields per Record and some adjustments in the return. The transformations can be
looked up here: `app/Http/Resources/ProductResource.php`

### Autogenerated Data (Seeder)

There is a command to generate some demo data:

`ddev php artisan db:seed`
